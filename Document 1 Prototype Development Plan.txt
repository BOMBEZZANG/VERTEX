Project VERTEX: Prototype Development Plan
1. Project Overview
Project Name (Working Title): Project VERTEX

Concept: A vertical physics-puzzle sandbox where the player must build a tower upwards while simultaneously digging downwards to reinforce the ground, managing the load of the tower.

Target Platform: PC (Steam)

Development Engine: Unity or Godot (Chosen for ease of use with 2D physics).

2. Core Objective of the Prototype
This prototype exists to answer a single question:

Is the core gameplay loop (Build → Face Limitation → Reinforce Underground → Retry) inherently fun and intellectually satisfying?

Obtaining a "Yes" to this question is the sole objective; everything else is secondary.

3. Core Features (Scope Definition)
[In-Scope Features]

Basic Unit Control: The ability to select one or more units and command them to 'Move', 'Dig', and 'Build'.

2D Tile-Based World: A map with a fixed horizontal width that scrolls infinitely only in the vertical direction.

Resource Tiers (2 Tiers):

Tier 1: Wood (Acquired from the surface).

Tier 2: Stone, Coal, Iron (Acquired from the shallow underground).

Core Physics Simulation:

Block Mass: Every tile and machine has a unique 'mass' value.

Load & Support: Blocks must bear the cumulative 'load' from all objects above them. Each material (wood, stone) has a unique 'support' limit.

Ground Stability: A value representing the total load that the surface-layer tiles beneath the tower's foundation can withstand.

Collapse: A collapse event occurs if a block's load exceeds its support value, or if the ground stability reaches zero.

Basic Construction:

Ability to construct Wood/Stone blocks, Wood supports/pillars, and Stone pillars.

Minimalist crafting facilities to process resources (e.g., Workbench, Furnace).

Minimalist UI: A minimal interface required to operate core functions, such as displaying resource counts and a construction menu.

[Out-of-Scope Features]

All Complex Simulations: All gas, liquid, temperature, and electrical systems are excluded.

Complex Unit AI: All psychological/status systems such as stress, hygiene, skills, and diseases are excluded.

Combat and External Threats: All combat-related content, including wildlife and hostile factions, is excluded.

Story and Quests: All narrative elements are excluded.

Economic Systems: All economy-related systems such as currency, trade, and employment are excluded.

Art and Sound: All art can be simple gray boxes. Sound will be absent or replaced with free sound effects.
